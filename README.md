Some features will require other plugins to function, however they are totally optional, more on that below.

3. Drag and drop the jar into your servers plugins directory.

### Optional Dependencies
Unlimited Currencies has two features that require the use of two different plugins to function.
You can install and use Unlimited Currencies without these plugins, but the two features won't be available.

* [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) - allows the use of placeholders that display the raw and formatted balances of a players currency.
* [DecentHolograms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/decentholograms-1-8-1-20-2-papi-support-no-dependencies.96927/) - allows the use of the falling hologram player feedback, spawning temporary holograms when a player gains/loses a currency.
